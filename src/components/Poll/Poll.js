      This is the beginning of the new polls feature. We've added a file <code>Poll.js</code> that should house the actual poll component, as well as a <code>PollPage.js</code> file that houses the page that displays the poll. It should be noted that you're free to fetch data in either component - is the poll responsible for fetching the data or will it be provided to it? You decide! Something third? Why not - we look forward to seeing your React-personality!

      Check the Readme (<code>README.md</code>) for more information about layout, data fetching etc. Have fun!
